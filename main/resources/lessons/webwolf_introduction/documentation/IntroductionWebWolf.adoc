== Introducing WebWolf

You only need WebWolf if a lesson specifies you can use it. For a lot of lessons you use WebGoat without
using WebWolf. Lessons where you can use WebWolf are marked with the following icon (top right in assignment):

Even if the icon is present, you are not obliged to use WebWolf, you can also use any intercepting tool you like.
(`netcat` etc.)

WebWolf opens in a new browser tab and is a separate web application which simulates an attacker's machine. It makes it possible for us to
make a clear distinction between what takes place on the attacked website and the actions you need to do as
an "attacker". WebWolf was introduced after a couple of workshops where we received feedback that there
was no clear distinction between what was part of the "attackers" role and what was part of the "users" role on the
website. The following items are supported in WebWolf:

* Hosting a file
* Receiving email
* Landing page for incoming requests
